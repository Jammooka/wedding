                    <p>We want to make the most of the venue and our quality time with you - but don't worry, you don't need to spend the full weekend with us! There are lots of things to do at and near the venue, and you are welcome to come and go as you wish.</p>

                    <p>You've already told us which meals you'll be around for, and we're catering accordingly. If you can't remember what you told us, please just ask and we can remind you! You'll be shocked to hear that there is indeed a spreadsheet...</p>

                    <p>Time for you to do whatever you fancy in Wilde Lodge's 15 acres of gardens and grounds, or to venture further afield. You can chill out with a book, go walking on Offas Dyke footpath or wild swimming in the River Teme, or visit nearby Knighton or Ludlow.</p>

                    <p>We'll most likely be chilling at Wilde Lodge catching up with anyone still around. Jamie's bringing a football, Sarah's looking forward to a nap.</p>

                    Semi-formal/dressy casual.<br><br>
                    We hadn't heard of this either. Google it and that's what we've got in mind.<br><br>
                    We want everyone to feel comfortable but also a bit dressed up.<br><br>
                    Jamie will be wearing a dark green suit with sneakers and may or may not wear a tie...<br><br>
                    Sarah will be the one in a wedding dress.<br><br>
                    There will be a getting ready area opened up near the tent village on Saturday morning. We're told there are mirrors and plug sockets aplenty.<br><br>
                    The venue is based on a farm, with mainly gravel and grass and some uneven surfaces. We hope to spend some of the wedding outside, so you may want to take that into consideration when choosing an outfit and footwear.<br><br>
                    For the rest of the weekend, wear what you want. Just something, please.<br><br>
                    There is a river for wild swimming so feel free to bring your bathers and towels. and we're in Britain, so assume rain will make an appearance at some point.

                    The showers have shower gel in them and we'll provide some emergency toiletries. Bring your usual toiletries and towels. Maybe a backup towel if you plan to swim in the river.

                    Yes! There's a nice long drive through the fields in front of the venue, and they park the cars along the left of it. Just rock up and you'll be guided in.
